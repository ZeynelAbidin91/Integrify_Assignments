    "A neural network is a network or circuit of neurons, or in a modern sense, an artificial neural network, composed of artificial neurons or nodes.  \n",
    "The connections of the biological neuron are modeled as weights denoted by $w$ in the following graph. A positive weight reflects an excitatory connection, while negative values mean inhibitory connections. All inputs are modified by a weight and summed . Finally, an activation function (in the following graph, denoted by $f$) controls the amplitude of the output. For example, an acceptable range of output is usually between 0 and 1, or it could be −1 and 1. It is said that each neuron in the following layer gets the linear combination of activations (referring to the use of $f$ in the image below) of neurons from the previous layer. "

The basic approach, if you do not know exactly what you want out of your method, is to use [Mean Square Error (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error) for regression problems and Percentage of error for classification problems. However, if you want _good_ results out of your method, you need to _define good_, and thus define the adequate cost function. This comes from both domain knowledge (what is your data, what are you trying to achieve), and knowledge of the tools at your disposal. \n",

Then, using gradient descent on this cost function will lead to a model which increases this probability as much as possible, and thus, maybe, overfit.\n",
