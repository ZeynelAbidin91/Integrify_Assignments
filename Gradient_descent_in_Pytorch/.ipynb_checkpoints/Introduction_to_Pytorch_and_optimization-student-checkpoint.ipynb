The basic approach, if you do not know exactly what you want out of your method, is to use [Mean Square Error (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error) for regression problems and Percentage of error for classification problems. However, if you want _good_ results out of your method, you need to _define good_, and thus define the adequate cost function. This comes from both domain knowledge (what is your data, what are you trying to achieve), and knowledge of the tools at your disposal. \n",

Then, using gradient descent on this cost function will lead to a model which increases this probability as much as possible, and thus, maybe, overfit.\n",

In order to avoid this issue, you can take the log of the probability, $\\log p(y_n | x_n)$.
